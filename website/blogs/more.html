    <h1>But wait! There's more.</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This event lead to the creation of the Greg Investigation Blog. So I was on greg.com and was using the Network tool in Chrome DevTools. I realized that the greg image was being loaded from a very unique URL.</p>
    <p>The URL, when clicked on, just lead to an AWS link. However, it was revealed that the file name of Greg was "freethings.com.jpg". So, I <a href="https://freethings.com">went there</a>.</p>
    <p>I did the same thing. This time, this money image's name was "payday.com.jpg". So, yet again, I <a href="https://payday.com">went there</a>.</p>
    <p>This time the background image was just the AWS link. That's when I hit a deadend.</p>
    <p>However, all of these domains are by "Reflex Publishing Inc." and they all have a <a href="https://motels.com">motels.com</a> ad.</p>
    <p>They also mostly follow the same format. Random word to gain attention, then toss some ads and a search bar in their face. They also all use the same AWS link aswell.</p>
