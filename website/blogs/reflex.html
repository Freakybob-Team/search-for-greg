    <h1>Reflex Publishing and its Controversies</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Reflex Publishing is the domain owner of greg.com and many <a href="more.html">other websites we've covered</a>.</p>
    <p>They are a company located in Tampa, Florida, and were started in 1997.</p>
    <p>Apparently, they have rejected offers up to <b>1 million dollars</b>, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5t9n3m/reflex_publishing_are_a_bunch_of_assholes/">a Reddit post.</a></p>
    <p>On their domains that they buy, they also put ads and an ad search bar on the lander, plus a random image.</p>
    <p>We also found their logo!</p>
