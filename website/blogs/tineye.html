    <h1>Tineye Investigation<h1>
    <hr>
    <p>So a couple of us at GIB decided to use Tineye to search for every reference of Greg.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to see for yourself, go on Tineye and search up the Greg image. [edited 9/13/25 to replace expired TinEye link]</p>
    <p>According to this, Greg was once present on 4Chan as a meme and also was on many orthodonist websites for some reason???</p>
    <p>There was also a crypto website that <a href="more.html">used the same image name as Reflex</a>.</p>
