    <h1>Tineye Investigation<h1>
    <hr>
    <p>So a couple of us at GIB decided to use Tineye to search for every reference of Greg.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to see for yourself, the link we used is <a href="https://tineye.com/search/2f4498f6c38c4f90e2a40cd31013af785b63b8cf?show_unavailable_domains=true">here</a>.</p>
    <p>According to this, Greg was once present on 4Chan as a meme and also was on many orthodonist websites for some reason???</p>
    <p>There was also a crypto website that <a href="more.html">used the same image name as Reflex</a>.</p>
